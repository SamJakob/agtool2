"""
This package contains the controller implementation and related classes that
make up the application's core.

The controller is the main application controller, which is responsible for
managing the application's lifecycle, configuration, plugins, and other core
components.

The purpose of the controller is to provide a single point of access to the
application's core components, which can be used to facilitate dependency
injection and other design patterns that make the application more modular and
easier to maintain, extend and test.

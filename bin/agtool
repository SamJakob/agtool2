# interpreter as a Python interpreter and execute the main function directly.

# This has the added bonus of allowing us to locate the Python files reliably.

# This launcher file is placed inside bin/ to allow that directory to be added
# to a user's PATH without inadvertently adding all the other files.

# Add the project path (parent of the current directory) to the system import
# path.

# to ensure that this file being placed inside the bin/ directory does not
# break resolution.

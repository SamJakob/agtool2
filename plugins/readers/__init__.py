This module is for organizational purposes only. The contents of the entire plugin
directory are automatically loaded recursively.

Readers are responsible for parsing a graph from some input source (e.g., a file
or URL). They parse the graph from some format (e.g., the `agtool` text format)
and return a graph object native to the application.

This module is for organizational purposes only. The contents of the entire plugin
directory are automatically loaded recursively.

Writers are responsible for writing a graph to some output destination (e.g., a file
or URL). They typically render the graph in some format (e.g., as a PNG image, or
as a PDF document), or they may simply serialize the graph in some format (e.g., as
a DOT file or JSON document).
